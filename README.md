# Cybersecurity Beginner Portfolio – Python Projects

## Overview
This repository contains two beginner Python projects I developed while exploring cybersecurity and programming. Both projects helped me practice Python fundamentals and think like a cybersecurity professional.

## Projects

### 1. Personal Password Analyzer
- Checks the strength of a password based on length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Provides personalized tips to improve weak passwords.
- Skills demonstrated: Python basics, loops, conditionals, input/output, logical thinking, and cybersecurity awareness.
- I developed this project on my phone using Pydroid 3, experimenting with different ways to evaluate passwords.

### 2. Secret Message Encoder/Decoder
- Encodes and decodes messages using a secret key (Caesar cipher), preserving spaces and punctuation.
- Skills demonstrated: String manipulation, functions, loops, conditionals, basic encryption, and cybersecurity mindset.
- Creating this project helped me understand basic encryption techniques and problem-solving in Python.

## How to Run
